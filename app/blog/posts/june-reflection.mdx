# Hi there!

My name is **Aca**, an aspiring programmer and part-time musician who thrives on challengesâ€”sometimes to the point of burnout. You might think I'm wasting my energy, but really, I'm just using it to the fullest. Though admittedly, I often scatter it instead of focusing on what truly matters.

## I am a people pleaser, I overanalyze everything, I think deeply, I get bored quickly, and I crave dopamine overload.

Why am I sharing all this? Some might say: 
"Isn't this website for your portfolio? Recruiters might see this and judge you based on what you've written!"
Yeah, I know. And that's probably true. But I guess I just like to write whatever's on my mind. Starting now, this feels like my safe space.

My biggest question mark right now is that I'm still wondering what my purpose in life is. I haven't found a compelling reason to continue living beyond pleasing my parents or making money. I don't have any grand purpose in mind yet. I always thought that if I excelled at everything, I would feel good and motivated to live, but that's not the case at all.

How exactly do you find purpose in life? What is your "Eureka Moment" when you finally discover what you want to do for the rest of your life? Or maybe you find it in wanting to protect or take care of someone special?

How does it feel when you have that grand purpose? Does it feel good? Does it make life more fulfilling than ever? Does having a grand purpose make you feel invincible, like you can tackle anything? At least that's what I've heard from countless motivational talks that supposedly help us find our goals and life's grand scheme.

Are we obliged to have one? And if we do, are we destined to live like mindless androids, following the same routine for ten years just to reach it?
